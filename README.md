| ⚡️🇳🇱 [Analysis of Energy Consumption and EV Growth in the Netherlands](https://github.com/dzrela/Analysis-of-Energy-Consumption-and-EV-Growth-in-the-Netherlands) | June 2024 | Python SQL Tableau | Utilizing a dataset on Energy Consumption in the Netherlands, together with Government data on Electric Vehicle Statistics in the Netherlands, I have developed this project to analyze whether there is a correlation regarding EV sales over a three-year period (2018-2020), with changes in the energy that is delivered back to the grid during that same timeframe. Finally, I created some visualizations using Tableau. |
